	 * The Ordered One And The Non Ordered One. At The Beginning,
	 * The Ordered List Is Formed By The First Element Of The Array, 
	 * And The Not Ordered One Corresponds To The Array To Sort Minus
	 * The First Element. The Algorithm At Every Step Takes The First
	 * Element From The Not Ordered List Value And Places It In The End 
	 * Of The Ordered One, By Comparing The Values Of The Added Element
	 * With Every Other One Element Of The Ordered List
	 * At The End Of The Algorithm The Ordered List Is The Sorted Array, 
	 * While The Other List Is Empty.
